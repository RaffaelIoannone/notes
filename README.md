# notes
First project for the CAS Frontend Engineering 2020

# templates
cd ./src/client/js/view
handlebars ./templates -f ./templates.js

# login 
For the login you can use something like "username: test, password: test". 

# notes
I didn't had time yet to do a proper hiding of elements, depending on the login status. 
Also some elements are not styled yet, because of time pressure.
